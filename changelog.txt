    - (Jerome) More drawing optimizations; time to refresh the view in
      vertical mode with 40+ schedules back from 18s to 2s. Schedule
      change events now have a 'needsLayout' property; if False, the
      schedule's bounding rect does not change so it's safe to redraw
      only this area.

 20100213
    - (Jerome) Avoid unnecessary repaints, using a bitmap cache. Also
      group consecutive resize events to minimize drawing.

    - (Jerome) Add Freeze/Thaw methods to wxScheduler for batch updates

    - (Jerome) Highlight current day

  20100201
    - (Jerome)  Start moving  all actual  drawing code  to  a separate
      class (wxDrawer).  This will allow  theming. In addition  to the
      base drawer, add a  drawer based on wx.GraphicsContext with some
      eye-candy like rounded rectangles and gradients.
