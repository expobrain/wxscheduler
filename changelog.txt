20101113

    would not be displayed correctly.

20101015

 20100724
    - Added make tarball target to build a tar.gz package automatically

 20100216
    - (Jerome) More drawing optimizations; time to refresh the view in
      vertical mode with 40+ schedules back from 18s to 2s. Schedule
      change events now have a 'needsLayout' property; if False, the
      schedule's bounding rect does not change so it's safe to redraw
      only this area.

 20100213

      group consecutive resize events to minimize drawing.

      eye-candy like rounded rectangles and gradients.
